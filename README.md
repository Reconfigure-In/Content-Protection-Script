# Content-Protection-Script

## Overview

This JavaScript code enhances the user experience on your web application by restricting certain interactions. It is designed to improve content protection and limit user actions that could interfere with your site.

## Key Features

- **Disable Text Selection**: Prevents users from highlighting or copying text, enhancing content protection.
- **Block Right-Click Context Menu**: Disables the default context menu that appears on right-click, reducing access to potentially sensitive options.
- **Restrict Developer Tools Access**: Blocks the opening of developer tools, making it harder for users to inspect elements and view source code.

## How to Use

To incorporate this script into your project, you can easily include it using a CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Reconfigure-In/Content-Protection-Script@refs/heads/main/script.js"></script>
```

### Example HTML Structure

Here’s a simple example of how to use this script within your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Webpage Title</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Reconfigure-In/Content-Protection-Script@refs/heads/main/script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Your Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This page restricts text selection and right-click actions for a smoother experience.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Important Notes

- While this script can deter casual users from copying content or using developer tools, it’s important to note that determined users can still find ways around these restrictions. Always consider additional security measures for sensitive content.
- Test the script thoroughly in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
